## Abstract
* Increasing municipal garbage poses a great threat to city sustainability especially in developing countries. It has become one of the main sources of environmental pollution in Chinese cities. Accordingly, Urban Garbage Classification is of great significance to city sustainability. Essentially, itâ€™s a social behavior and entails public participation. Based on Shanghai Garbage Classification System, MLP, CNN, and ANN models are utilized to solve the garbage classification problems. Our findings show that CNN and ANN models are more suitable for image handling. The best model, Vision Transformer, achieves an accuracy of 0.935 on the test set, suggesting its effectiveness on garbage classification. Also, some visualization tools are used to provide better analysis. Our study provides a new solution for urban garbage classification. It can be an useful tool for the government to protect environment and the sustainable development of cities.
